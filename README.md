# SLCDSignIn

This is a personal project aimed at helping the career services center on Western Oregon's Campus. I am a currently employee there and we have been doing all of our sign ups for events on paper and then transferring them over to Excel which is a waste of time and resources. This is a very simple GUI that allows a user to input the information my office is interested in and creates a binary excel file to be made with a a function under the file tab. This is simply a project that interested me and would actually be used to help accomplish a problem.
